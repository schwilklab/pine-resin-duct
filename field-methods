# **Field Methods** #

- Travel to coordinates of randomly selected point
	- Walk in direction of randomly selected number up to 300 m
- Once a tree is encountered, select a random azimuth to obtain tree core
	- Core tree to a little past the middle pith.
	- Wrap core in paper towel and seal with duct tape
	- **Record name, species, tag number, DBH, location, and date**
- If evidence of bark beetle attack, estimate attack success
	- Select random azimuth on tree, and count number of exit holes within the 30X30 cm square.
		- Repeat 3 times
	- **Record number of attacks for each density sample**
- Select a .5X.5 m area within ~3 m of the selected tree
	- Remove all plant material from the plot
	- Dig ~15 cm down and place soil inside of ziploc bag
		- Repeat the process 3 times, using the same bag to collect soil
	- **Record name, mountain range, tag number, and date**
- Measure competition surrounding the selected tree
	- Use Cruz-all, holding it 25 cm from the eye, looking at the height at DBH of surrounding trees
	- Count all trees that are larger than the 10 mark that are within 10 meters of the selected tree
	- Do a 360 degree sweep of the area, counting all trees fit the category
	- Measure DBH of those trees that were larger than the 10 mark
	- **Record genus of tree (species if known), DBH, azimuth from cored tree, and distance from cored tree**

# ******Only 2 trees per species can be sampled per point!****** #
